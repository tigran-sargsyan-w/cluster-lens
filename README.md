# 42 Cluster Lens 🛰️🗺️

Welcome to **42 Cluster Lens** — an alternative interactive cluster map for 42 campuses. It makes the map feel alive, useful, and reliable: it loads fast, shows relevant info, and helps you navigate in real time.

> If the official “Intra” map doesn’t load or doesn’t show what you need — **Cluster Lens** has your back and gives you more.

## 🚀 What it is and why it matters

**42 Cluster Lens** is a visual cluster map that:

- helps you **quickly see where seats are free**;
- provides **live statistics about people and promos**;
- stays reliable even when the official map is slow or unavailable;
- makes on-campus navigation easier and more pleasant;
- surfaces key data **without bouncing through dozens of pages**.

The project was created to solve everyday student pain points:
- “Where are free seats right now?”
- “Why is the official map not loading?”
- “Why is the official map not zooming?”
- “How can I instantly see the cluster load?”
- “Who can check me, and who might need my check?”

## 🧠 Why statistics are a key feature

Statistics in **Cluster Lens** are not just “occupied vs free.” They help you understand **who is around and how you can help each other**:

- you can see **how many people are from each promo** — which matters because new promo students often have check limitations;
- you immediately know **who can check you** and **who might need your check**;
- you can spot **more experienced students (older promos / higher levels)** and quickly identify who to ask for advice or help;
- all of this is visible **right on the map**, without extra navigation or waiting.

That’s why statistics are one of the most valuable and “alive” features of the project.

## ⚔️ How we differ from the official 42 (Intra) map

| Feature | Official map | 42 Cluster Lens |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Load speed & stability | Sometimes unavailable | Stable and fast ✅ |
| Promo/level statistics | No | Yes ✅ |
| Quick “who can check” overview | No | Yes ✅ |
| Level/status on the map | No | Yes (overlay) ✅ |
| Mobile usability (zoom) | Often awkward | Fully supported ✅ |
| Number of page hops | Many | Minimal ✅ |
| Pleasant UI | Basic | More lively and friendly ✅ |

**In short:** the official map is the “minimum.” **Cluster Lens** is the map you actually want to use every day.
