# 42 Cluster Lens 🛰️🗺️

> [!WARNING]
> ## Archived Project Notice
> This repository is now **archived** and is **no longer actively maintained**.
>
> **42 Cluster Lens** was built as a richer cluster experience with an interactive map, statistics, overlays, and additional navigation features. However, over time, the project became too dependent on unstable 42 API behavior, rate limits, and backend maintenance requirements.
>
> Because of these recurring API-related issues, maintaining the full-stack architecture of **Cluster Lens** is no longer practical for me.
>
> To provide a more stable and lightweight alternative, I created **42 Cluster Stats** — a browser extension that shows live cluster occupancy statistics directly on the 42 intra clusters page with a much simpler and more reliable approach.
>
> 👉 **Use the actively maintained project instead:**

## About this project
Welcome to **42 Cluster Lens** — an alternative interactive cluster map for 42 campuses. It makes the map feel alive, useful, and reliable: it loads fast, shows relevant info, and helps you navigate in real time.

> If the official “Intra” map doesn’t load or doesn’t show what you need — **Cluster Lens** has your back and gives you more.

## 🚀 What it is and why it matters

**42 Cluster Lens** is a visual cluster map that:

- helps you **quickly see where seats are free**;
- provides **live statistics about people and promos**;
- stays reliable even when the official map is slow or unavailable;
- makes on-campus navigation easier and more pleasant;
- surfaces key data **without bouncing through dozens of pages**.

The project was created to solve everyday student pain points:
- “Where are free seats right now?”
- “Why is the official map not loading?”
- “Why is the official map not zooming?”
- “How can I instantly see the cluster load?”
- “Who can check me, and who might need my check?”

---

## 🧠 Why statistics are a key feature

Statistics in **Cluster Lens** are not just “occupied vs free.” They help you understand **who is around and how you can help each other**:

- you can see **how many people are from each promo** — which matters because new promo students often have check limitations;
- you immediately know **who can check you** and **who might need your check**;
- you can spot **more experienced students (older promos / higher levels)** and quickly identify who to ask for advice or help;
- all of this is visible **right on the map**, without extra navigation or waiting.

That’s why statistics are one of the most valuable and “alive” features of the project.

## 🧩 Core features

- **Interactive map** of 42 clusters
- **Promo and level statistics** + visual highlighting
- **Overlay module**: quick view of a student’s level and status (Common Core completed / not yet)
- **Full mobile support**: zooming and navigation that work smoothly on phones
- **Fast load times and stable performance**
- Clean UI without clutter

## ⚔️ How we differ from the official 42 (Intra) map

| Feature | Official map | 42 Cluster Lens |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Load speed & stability | Sometimes unavailable | Stable and fast ✅ |
| Promo/level statistics | No | Yes ✅ |
| Quick “who can check” overview | No | Yes ✅ |
| Level/status on the map | No | Yes (overlay) ✅ |
| Mobile usability (zoom) | Often awkward | Fully supported ✅ |
| Number of page hops | Many | Minimal ✅ |
| Pleasant UI | Basic | More lively and friendly ✅ |

**In short:** the official map is the “minimum.” **Cluster Lens** is the map you actually want to use every day.

## 🎯 Who it’s for

- 42 students looking for free seats;
- anyone who wants to quickly find people to check with or talk to;
- mentors and staff who need fast orientation;
- anyone who wants a stable and friendly tool.

## 🏗️ Architecture & flow

This repo is **full‑stack**: a static front‑end + a Cloudflare Worker back‑end.

```
User (browser)
   │
   ├──> Frontend (Vercel) ──┐
   │                        │
   └──> Worker (Cloudflare) ├──> 42 API (OAuth + data)
                            └──> KV Cache (seatmap + sessions)
```

### Frontend (apps/web)
- Static HTML/CSS/JS pages (`index.html`, `cluster.html`, `profile.html`).
- Calls the Worker for OAuth, session validation, cluster data, and user overlays.
- Deployed on **Vercel** with clean URLs support. 

### Backend (apps/worker)
- Cloudflare Worker handling OAuth, session storage, and data aggregation.
- Uses **KV** to cache seatmaps, sessions, and user data to reduce 42 API load.
- Includes background seatmap refresh with cooldowns for rate limits.
- Exposes endpoints: `/login`, `/callback`, `/session`, `/cluster`, `/user` and debug helpers.

## 📦 Repository structure

```
apps/
  web/      # Frontend (static pages + JS/CSS)
  worker/   # Cloudflare Worker backend
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment model (Vercel + Cloudflare)

- **Frontend**: Vercel serves static pages and is already configured for clean URLs. 
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Worker + KV (Wrangler config in `apps/worker`).

Both platforms support **automatic deployments** when connected to a Git repo (Vercel Git integration + Cloudflare Wrangler CI). This repo is laid out to make that split‑deploy workflow straightforward. 

---

## 🔐 OAuth & privacy

- Login happens on 42’s side via OAuth.
- No passwords are stored.
- The Worker only stores short‑lived session tokens in KV.
